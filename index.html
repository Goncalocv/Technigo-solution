    <h2>What is browser compatibility</h2>

      <p> Web browsers work as form of translator. They translate the code written in HTML  and display the content in a webpage. 
          Different browsers have their own way and their own capabilities of translating code. 
          Although there is a standard set of rules for scripting HTML code, most of the 
          differences between the browsers are in the way they interpret or translate it.</p>

      <p> Browser compatibility refers to the capability and flexibility of a website, web application, script or HTML design to 
          work on the different web browsers that are available. It also can be described as the potential of a web browser to efficiently 
          display the HTML code and carry out the scripts on web pages.</p>
          Besides the browser differences, another element that affects  browser compatibility is whether the user is surfing the web on a regular computer and whether the operating system is Windows, Mac or Linux. The exact same browser can render the webpages slightly differently on all these platforms.
          Other factors that can affect browser compatibility are screen sizes and resoltions

   <h2>Why is it important?</h2>

      It is important to make sure your browser is compatible with as many browsers as possible because not everyone uses the same browser.
      If your site is not compatible with a particular browser, users of that browser will have a frustrating experience and may choose 
      to exit before completing purchases or engaging with information. Such user experience problems can massively affect the bottom line – 
      88% of online consumers say they’re less likely to return to a site after a bad experience.
